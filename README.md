# "Photo process" compositional approach

## Brief description

"Photo process" is a composer-centric creative approach/framework that allows a composer to implement an idea or a set of ideas and then alter the material to get an unexpectedly modified form by applying some suggested actions. Whole process is strongly visualized and connected with events of the recent past that belong to the world of photography - from loading a film roll into a camera to working with developed film and printing photos (or not).

## Introduction

Applying actions from different processes within different contexts is quite common for creative applications. Since the beginning of 20th century artists were mixing different techniques, genres and directions in order to achieve a new form that would answer existing questions or ask something that was not asked before or something else, yet unknown. Allowing to choose became a wild idea for both creators and recipients of art works. That's what current work is also targeting.

## Explanation and definitions of approach

The idea of current approach came to me when I was thinking over my past experience while searching for a way that would allow me to transform my ideas into something new and interesting for me at first. The approach later became a set of guidelines, then a set of choices and finally - the framework. It was created primarily for musical composers but can be extended to any artistic process.

Framework is tightly connected with a depiction of analog photo process from the very start but the end point as well as many other things are determined by the composer. Composer is also free to decide when he actually wants to involve the listener as whole process is accessible stage by stage and allows composer to get new experience from working with ideas in a slightly different manner. Accurate control of every stage makes the transformation/alteration process available for sharing at any step or iteration and only composer's will is the limitation here. It is somewhat similar to a version control - a recipient can be allowed to receive a single commit or set of commits or whole log since some particular point. One can also find parallels with a non-linear video editor.

In following chapters you will find detailed description of actual analog film processing, possible defects and further applications.

## Photo process as a model
### General "why-what" array
* Scalable: default values of 12-24-36 frames where frame is whatever you want - particle, note, sequence, sound, event etc.
* Different moves/parts can be assigned to different parts of process
* Different methods can be applied per each section/move/part
* Unexpected changes and microchanges
* Layering ideas/stories
* Either a single story or a collection of stories/events (like movements)
* Shadowing parts with another parts for hyperlinking and linking within a composition
* Rich modelling possibilities after various scenarios of actual film usage: from experimental photography or lomography to faulty cheap camera in hands of elderly people who are attached to it and still take (or took?) family pictures with it, film could be recent or old, yours or found - think about scenarios like old film found in someone's belongings and developed out of curiosity 

### Detailed description
From taking a film up to printing it.

#### Photo laboratory
Customer leaves undeveloped film - order is pre-paid.
Developing: with special tool you retract the film's tail, cut it and attach to a leader - flexible plastic page of ~A5 size with perforation in the middle - with special duct tape. Then you check the developing machine - chemicals (developer, fixer, washer) should be filled in correctly and machine should be heated up and ready. All temperature values should be fine too according to the currently used developing process. Starting the machine will make the gears rotate so a leader with attached film can be hooked up by perforation, carefully taken through tanks with chemicals and developed.


### List of possible limitations, alterations and defects
Please note that actual data might ignore predefined limits (ISO, # of shots etc.) and exceed them or be less.

#### Film
Standard of 12, 24 or 36 shots. Half-frame camera can double that number.

#### Optics
Focus
Exposure
Particular details added to original (viewed) image: dust, hair, scratches, glares

#### Mechanics
Film retraction, multiexposition
Damaged parts: scratches, unexpected highlightings and overexposures
Shutter and/or mirror (if present): constantly recurring overexposure and other defects

#### Development
Wrong chemicals or wrong proportions: wrong, limited or no colors or even no image, wrong exposure/contrast processing
Process mistakes: not enough time for developer so image are bleak, not enough time for fixer so reactions are not fixed and film continues to be exposed/damaged/destroyed over time
Scratches, tears and other physical damage that could be added during film development 

#### Scanning/Printing
Single, constant or recurring dust, hair, scratches (manual or automated and single frame or frame groups)
Process mistakes and wrong chemicals (see above)
Paper defects

#### Controlled deconstruction (on purpose)
Cross process: swapping chemicals on purpose to get different colors
Infrared film: black and white but more details in some cases
Multiexposition
Alternative optics: fisheye, quad or more lens, color filters, color flashlight
Push ISO: overdevelop film to get higher ISO value (more details revealed) than provided by manufacturer
