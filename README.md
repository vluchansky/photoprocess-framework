# "Photo process" compositional approach

## Brief description

"Photo process" is a composer-centric creative approach/framework that allows a composer to implement an idea or a set of ideas and then alter the material to get an unexpectedly modified form by applying some suggested actions. Whole process is strongly visualized and connected with events of the recent past that belong to the world of photography - from loading a film roll into a camera to working with developed film and printing photos (or not).

## Introduction

Applying actions from different processes within different contexts is quite common for creative applications. Since the beginning of 20th century artists were mixing different techniques, genres and directions in order to achieve a new form that would answer existing questions or ask something that was not asked before or something else, yet unknown. Allowing to choose became a wild idea for both creators and recipients of art works. That's what current work is also targeting.

## Explanation and definitions of approach

The idea of current approach came to me when I was thinking over my past experience while searching for a way that would allow me to transform my ideas into something new and interesting for me at first. The approach later became a set of guidelines, then a set of choices and finally - the framework. It was created primarily for musical composers but can be extended to any artistic process.

Framework is tightly connected with a depiction of analog photo process from the very start but the end point as well as many other things are determined by the composer. Composer is also free to decide when he actually wants to involve the listener as whole process is accessible stage by stage and allows composer to get new experience from working with ideas in a slightly different manner. Accurate control of every stage makes the transformation/alteration process available for sharing at any step or iteration and only composer's will is the limitation here. It is somewhat similar to a version control - a recipient can be allowed to receive a single commit or set of commits or whole log since some particular point. One can also find parallels with a non-linear video editor.

In following chapters you will find detailed description of actual analog film processing,
